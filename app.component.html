<h1>Taj Mahal</h1>
<div id="main">
 <IMG SRC="https://pixahive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Taj-Mahal-253014-pixahive.jpg" >
  <pre>   The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631,  to be built 
         in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, 
          while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.
     Construction started in 1632,[16] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648,
     while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.
  The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal 
     illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.
  According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori 
  and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show the same level of affection to others 
  as he had shown her while she was alive. He avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief,
  along with giving up listening to music and dressing lavishly for two years.
  Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on
  which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. This place was chosen for
 the construction of Mumtaz's tomb by Shah Jahan and Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor.
The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture.
Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including 
 the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),
 Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site,
Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. 
While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the 
use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.</pre>

<pre style="text-align:center;font-family:tahoma;color:black;">Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal Love story and the facts about their life history and the theme of the Taj Mahal stories are available everywhere.
   There is too much said and written about the biographies of Shah Jahan and Mumtaj blogs already.

  The present blog discloses some unknown facts about their life such as where both of them met first?
   How did Mumtaz Mahal die? Where did she die? How many children they have? Why was the Taj Mahal build? Did Mumtaz see the Taj? Etc. 
  Such questions often come to your mind before planning the Taj Mahal Tour.
   Besides providing the answers to the most asked questions this blog presents the full description of her death and the circumstances.
   The prince Shahabuddin Muhammad Khuram was born to Emperor Jahangir and the Hindu Mother Jodhabai in the year 1592. 
   He had the title name as Shahjahan later which signifies the “Emperor of the world”. He was born with a silver spoon and enjoyed 
   all the privileges of the royal legacy, had the martial training and studied theology and academies from the best Scholars. 
   His grandfather Akbar showered immense love for him.</pre><hr style="background-color: black;">
   <h3>Tomb</h3>
   <p style="text-align:center;font-family:tahoma;color:black;">
    The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on
    a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial.
    Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.

    The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is 
    approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted
    archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the
    chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb,
    one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal 
    and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.
    The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is
    close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical "drum" it sits on, which is approximately
    7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome). The top is decorated
    with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris
    (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical. Their columned
    bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (guldastas) extend from edges 
    of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. 
    The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.

    The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature
     provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements.[27] The finial is topped by a moon, 
     a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.

    The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed 
    as working minarets – a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret 
    is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony
    surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus
    design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, 
    a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.

<h3>Garden</h3>
<p>The complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square charbagh or Mughal garden. The garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the 
  four-quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised
   marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north–south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank
    is called al Hawd al-Kawthar in reference to the "Tank of Abundance" promised to Muhammad.

  Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific names[40] and fountains. The charbagh garden,
   a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of 
   Jannah (Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian paridaeza, meaning 'walled garden.' In mystic Islamic texts of the 
   Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden 
  of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Most Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main element, the tomb,
   is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh or "Moonlight Garden" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation
    of the Archaeological Survey of India is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's design and was meant to be seen as one

     of the rivers of Paradise.[41] Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggests both gardens may have been
      designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan.[42] Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses,
       daffodils, and fruit trees.[43] As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj Mahal and its gardens also declined. By the 19th century, the British
        Empire controlled more than three-fifths of India,[44] and assumed management of the Taj Mahal. They changed the landscaping to their liking
         which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.</p>

<h3>Construction</h3>

<p>
  The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.[46] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen expected it to take years to dismantle.[47]

The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. Some 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters were used.[48] The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from the Punjab region, jade and crystal from China. The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the white marble.[49]

According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.[50] A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of 20 or 30 oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.[51] An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into the desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank. It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.[citation needed]

The plinth and tomb took some 12 years to complete. The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway. Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on "completion". Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643[16] while work on the outlying buildings continued for years. Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time. The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about ₹ 32 million,[16] which is around ₹ 52.8 billion ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.[52]

<h3>Tourism</h3>

<p>
  The Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001,[77] which had increased to about 7–8 million in 2014.[78] A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners. As of 2022, the fee for Indian citizens was ₹50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was ₹540 and for other foreign tourists, it was ₹1,100.[79] Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre.[80][81] In 2019, in order to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.[82]

  The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers.[83] Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes.[84]
  
  The grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 hours on weekdays, except on Friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 14:00 hours. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after,[85] excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.
  
  Foreign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India. Notable figures who have travelled to the site include Dwight Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George Harrison, Vladimir Putin, Princess Diana, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Philip.[86][8
